# ESP8266
After a lot of pain and trauma I have managed to do this my arduino and the ESP8266 wifi module. It is simple list of commands that you can run on the wifi module. I will keep expanding it and working on it. I will also post a picture of my board setup so that I don't forget it myself when I look back at it after a week !!

You can find the list of commands here: https://nurdspace.nl/ESP8266#AT_Commands
